A companion deep-dive to our engineering debt post. The distributed monolith is the most common failure mode in microservices migrations — and it is invisible until it is expensive to fix.

## What Makes a System a Distributed Monolith

A distributed monolith has the network boundaries of microservices but the coupling characteristics of a monolith. You cannot deploy, scale, or reason about any single service in isolation.

## The Three Coupling Traps

**Deployment coupling:** Services must be released together. **Data coupling:** Multiple services read and write to the same database. **Domain coupling:** Business logic for a single capability is spread across several services.

## How to Detect Coupling Before It Hardens

Track how often a change in one service requires a simultaneous change in another. If that number is trending up, your services are not independent — they are a monolith with network latency.

## Refactoring Toward True Service Independence

Start by identifying the highest-coupling pairs. Introduce an anti-corruption layer, migrate shared data to service-owned stores, and define explicit contracts at every boundary.
